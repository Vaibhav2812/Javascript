/*
*I want you to create a simple guess the number type game.
*It should choose a random number between 1 and 100,
*then challenge the player to guess the number in 10 turns. 
*After each turn the player should be told if they are right or wrong â€” and,
*if they are wrong, whether the guess was too low or too high.
*It should also tell the player what numbers they previously guessed. 
*The game will end once the player guesses correctly, or once they run out of turns.
 *When the game ends, the player should be given an option to start playing again.
