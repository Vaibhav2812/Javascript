        <p>
            there are a couple of problems with our bio() method â€” the output always includes the pronoun "He", even if your person is
            female, or some other preferred gender classification. And the bio will only include two interests, even if more
            are listed in the interests array. Can you work out how to fix this in the class definition (constructor)? You
            can put any code you like inside a constructor (you'll probably need a few conditionals and a loop). Think about
            how the sentences should be structured differently depending on gender, and depending on whether the number of
            listed interests is 1, 2, or more than 2.
