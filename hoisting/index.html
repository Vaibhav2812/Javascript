                    I have an HTML table with five cells in it. Each cell has a button and a field. You do not have
                    control
                    over the HTML or naming conventions used for IDs, etc. Write an event handler that can be applied
                    to each
                    button which will call a function and write the result of that function to the field that is in the
                    cell of
                    the button that was clicked. Do not iterate over the cells of the table.
                </summary>
                <div>
                    <table id="myTable">
                        <tr>
                            <td id="cell1"><button>Cell 1</button></td>
                            <td id="cell2"><button>Cell 2</button></td>
                            <td id="cell3"><button>Cell 3</button></td>
                            <td id="cell4"><button>Cell 4</button></td>
                            <td id="cell5"><button>Cell 5</button></td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>
                </div>

        <li>
            Explain to me how OOP works in JavaScript. This is going to involve a conversation about prototype
            inheritance, closures, and lexical scoping.
        </li>
        <li>
            Give me an example of something that you would use a closure for - explain the closure you’ve written.
        </li>
        <li>
            Describe how you would develop a single-page application without using a framework (this one is more of a
            discussion and covers performance and the memory leaks Dean mentioned).
        </li>
        <li>I need to be able to store a DOM element so that it may, based on the results of a LATER event be moved
            from one container element to another. For example, I need to create a button which removes an LI from an
            OL or UL. The element needs to be stored during the current session so that - based on the result of
            ANOTHER event, I can then either attach it to the second container, move it back to the first container, or
            discard it. (I’m interested in their knowledge of scoping in the session.. if they recommend a global, I’ll
            say ok, if we don’t want to use a global variable what other options do we have? This is not an over
            difficult question, but it allows you to see how they think when the obvious answer isn’t the best choice).
